        <h4>My story</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">Hello :) my name is Harry and I'm a full stack developer. In July 2017, I graduated from Durham University with a degree in Anthropology, and subsequently began to pursue my passion for technology startups. In November later that year, I moved to London to start a new job in the Business Development team at a startup called <a href="https://www.what3words.com" class="website-link" target="_blank">what3words</a>. During my time there, I was lucky enough to travel to a number of different cities across the world, such as San Francisco, Los Angeles and Tokyo, and enjoyed gaining a formal introduction into the world of startups.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">However, in June 2018, I left what3words after deciding that I wanted to try and be the person helping to build such amazing technologies, rather than the person selling them. So, in July 2018 I enrolled at <a href="https://www.lewagon.com" class="website-link" target="_blank">Le Wagon</a>'s coding bootcamp in London. Le Wagon is an intensive 9-week coding bootcamp, during which I, and 3 other team members, managed to build our first ever web app - Tripper. On the last day of the bootcamp, I presented our project in front of 200 people at Google Campus, which you can watch <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/demoday/173/tripper" class="website-link" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">After finishing Le Wagon in mid-September, I'm now actively looking for work as a junior developer, preferably at a London-based startup.</p>
