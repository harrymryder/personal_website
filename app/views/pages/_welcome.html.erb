              My name is Harry and I'm an anthropology graduate from Durham University. After graduating in 2017 I worked at what3words - a global startup that has divided the world into a grid of 57 trillion 3x3m squares and given each square a unique 3 word address.

            <p>
              I subsequently learnt to code and then became a teaching assistant at the same coding bootcamp. Now, I am volunteering for a NGO called the Swiss-Sierra Leone Development Foundation in Makeni, Sierra Leone.

              I am currently looking for my next challenge, specifically at an exciting startup that makes a difference or a company focused on sustainability. Please feel free to fill in the form at the bottom of this website if you wish to contact me.
